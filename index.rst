Jupyter Widgets Unofficial Extensions & Tools
=============================================

The `jupyter-widgets-contrib <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets-contrib/>`_ organization contains a collection of
community-contributed unofficial libraries. Each
extension is stored in a independent GitHub repository.

Those repositories are maintained independently by a group of users and developers and not officially
related to the jupyter-widgets development team.

The maturity of the provided extensions varies.

So please create an issue in the relevant extension github
repository if you encounter any problems, want to suggest a feature or an improvement or would like to help.

If you want to transfer your extension within this organization, `open an issue <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets-contrib/jupyter-widgets-contrib.github.io/issues/new?labels=transfer&template=transfer-repository-to-this-organization.md>`_.
If you want to help supporting the extensions in this organization, propose PRs and/or answer issues on the
relevant repositories. If the extension has been **archived**, you can `request access <https://github.com/jupyter-widgets-contrib/jupyter-widgets-contrib.github.io/issues/new?template=help-with-maintenance.md>`_.
